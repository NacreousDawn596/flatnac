# flatnac
a simple python and bash script to make launching flatpak apps easier

# How to download it:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/NacreousDawn596/flatnac
cd flatnac
chmod u+x setup.sh
./setup
```

# How to use it:
now instead of doing ***flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client*** you can do ***flatnac install com.spotify.Client*** then you can customize the name to launch the app, in my case I choosed spotify, so instead of writing ***flatpak run com.spotify.Client*** I do ***spotify***.

Enjoy!
